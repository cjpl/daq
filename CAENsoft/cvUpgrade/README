A. DESCRIPTION
----------------

cvUpgrade is a software tool for firmware upgrade of supported CAEN  boards.
New firmware releases can be uploaded to the board non-volatile (flash) memory.

cvUpgrade basically reads firmware image from a binary input file (Altera Raw
Binary File format) and writes it to proper locations in the target board flash
device, by relying on functions provided by the CAENComm API library.
A parameter file (ascii) is used to set board specific parameters (register
address, flash informations etc).

cvUpgrade  also allows to read the CAEN board IDcode (each boards has a unique 
IDcode). The license of some special firmware (i.e. DPP firmware) is tied to 
this IDcode.

cvUpgrade  also allows to read the license data stored into the board and optionally
delete it.

CAENComm allows cvupgrade to access target board via USB 
 or via CAEN proprietary CONET optical link. 
Following CAEN boards can be used to upgrade target board firmware:

  - A2818 PCI CONET Controller + V2718 VME-PCI Optical Link Bridge
  - A2818 PCI CONET Controller only, if target board has a direct CONET slave 
    optical link interface.   
	
CAENComm supports the following channels of communication:

1) PC => USB => CAEN Front-end Modules with USB 2.0 interface:
                - CAEN Waveform digitizers with USB interface (NIM/Desktop form factors)
                - N957 8k Multi-Channel Analyzer
2) PC => USB => V1718 => VME => all CAEN VME Modules
3) PC => PCI (A2818) => Optical Link => CAEN Modules with Opt. link:
                - Waveform digitizers (VME, NIM/Desktop form factors)
                - SY2791 TPC Readout System
4) PC => PCI (A2818) => Optical Link => V2718 => VME => all CAEN VME Modules

Please ensure that latest CAEN provided drivers are properly installed prior
to use of the cvupgrade application.
  
IMPORTANT NOTE: 

Both firmware images on flash (standard/backup) can be written by cvupgrade,
regardless of the image selction jumper on board.

retrieve the IDcode data from the board and store it on BoardInfo-MN-SN.dat file 
(MN is the board model name, if provided from command line, and SN is the board serial number) OR
retrieve or delete the license data from the board: to delete the license file you must specify the -delete option
