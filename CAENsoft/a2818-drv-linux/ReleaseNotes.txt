  web site: http://www.caen.it.


 System Requirements
 -------------------

  - CAEN A2818 PCI Board
  - Linux kernel 2.4 or 2.6 and GNU C/C++ compiler

  What's New in Rel. 1.13
  --------------------------
   - BUGFIX on proc entry registration
   - BUGFIX on a2818_init_board: memory was not well dealocated in case of errors
   - BUGFIX on cleanup_module: Bad deallocation of kernel memory

  What's New in Rel. 1.12
  --------------------------
   - added usage count management to avoid system hang unloading a busy module

  What's New in Rel. 1.11
  --------------------------
   - Added SAFE_MODE to avoid system hang with concurrent processes accessing 
	   more than one A2818 in the same PC.

  What's New in Rel. 1.10
  --------------------------

    - Added conditional compiler directive to comply with kernel versions >= 2.6.23

  What's New in Rel. 1.9
  --------------------------

   New Features and Important Notes
   --------------------------------
   
    - a2818_link_reset: modified udelay value to 10 msec to comply with CAENLink devices
    - BUGFIX on a2818_init_board: s->timeout was setted to a fixed jiffes number: 
      now the timeout value is setted in msecs and converted to jiffes
    - Substitution of milliseconds udelay's calls with mdelay once

  
  What's New in Rel. 1.8
  --------------------------

   New Features and Important Notes
   --------------------------------

    - Register device only if HW is present otherwise the kernel
      crashes with a cat /proc/devices
    - ioctl:A2818_IOCTL_IRQ_WAIT now returns ETIMEDOUT instead of -ETIMEDOUT, in order to give
      to CAENVMElib a chance to detect IRQ timeout errors

  What's New in Rel. 1.7
  --------------------------

   New Features and Important Notes
   --------------------------------

    - Better error handling in the link fail: it did not reset correctly
      when disconnected during a communication.


  What's New in Rel. 1.6
  --------------------------

   New Features and Important Notes
   --------------------------------

    - Bug fix on a2818_ioctl, case A2818_IOCTL_SEND: added packet's
        header build step
    Contributions from Brent Casavant at Silicon Graphics, Inc. (bcasavan@sgi.com)
    - Port to 64-bit architectures
    - Ensure writes are flushed to I/O domain where necessary ( Linux Version>= 2.6.10)
    - Allocate DMA memory correctly for architectures with IOMMUs (Linux Version >= 2.6.9)
    - Unlocked ioctl() method alleviates system performacne problems ( Linux Version>= 2.6.11)

  What's New in Rel. 1.5
  --------------------------

   New Features and Important Notes
   --------------------------------

    - Kernel 2.6.9 porting
