** Sources, archives and documents
   1. Directory */opt/DAQ/repos* contains common archives, sources and
      documents.
   2. */opt/DAQ/repos/bot* -- MIDAS/PSI related sources, Please read *README.txt*
   3. */opt/DAQ/repos/daq* -- codes developed in CIAE
   4. */opt/DAQ/repos/doc* -- manuals and etc., *hw-man* contains all related
      hardware manuals.
   3. Software information
      + MIDAS   -- http://midas.psi.ch, https://midas.psi.ch/htmldoc/index.html
      + ROOT    -- http://root.cern.ch
      + ROODY   -- https://daq-plone.triumf.ca/SR/ROODY
      + ROOTANA -- https://daq-plone.triumf.ca/SR/rootana

** Working directory
   1. *$HOME/online* is the acquisition workspace. Each experiment has its own
      directory within it.
   2. *$HOME/workspace* is the development workspace. It is syncronized online
      with [[http://github.com/cjpl][GitHub]].

* Collaboration and running
** Online repositories
   + http://cjpl.github.com/
   + Each developer should has his/her own account on GitHub. The accounts are
     grouped as perticular purpose.
** Logging
   + All hardwares should be monitored. The work conditions should be recorded
     in time, especially when it needs repare.
   + Taskes should be applied to proper one.
   + Coding: write, test, fix bug, ...
